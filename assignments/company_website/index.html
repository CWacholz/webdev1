    <h1> DualShockers </h1>
 <h2> Anything and Everything Gaming </h2>
  <h3> Here's a Little About Us </h3>
   <p> Outside of our relentless news reporting, DualShockers also provides its community of readers with a plethora of in-depth previews, editorials, guides, and of course: reviews (which are featured on Metacritic). </p>
     
   <p> Since publishing our first article in July of 2009, DualShockers has become an established name in the video game industry. What initially set out to be a means of “getting into E3” has transformed into a 24/7 365 publication that is renown by hardcore gamers throughout the world for breaking and reporting news in the video game industry — and all things related to video games — as it happens. </p>
